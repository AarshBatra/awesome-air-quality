Since fight against Air pollution is in such a nascent age, people everywhere are solving the same problems with different approaches. This is leading to a lot of time lost on our side in the fight.

Our aim here is to let people know who all are fighting air pollution in the same space as you so that:
1. You do not have to start from scratch and solve the same problems as some one else has.
2. If you need some service/product, you know what your options are.
3. The data that you get to is not bound by your google skills.

## What we are not!

1. We are not a news site.
2. We do not now and will not ever charge for this. (Maybe un till Github asks us to.. ðŸ¤”)
3. We do not play favorites, please don't ask us too.
4. Everything here is being done in open, let us know if you have any concerns. (Create an [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/))
